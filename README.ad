Simple bank scraper

== Challenge
We kindly ask you to develop on your own a very small project outlined below.
Develop a console program that signs in to your personal bank account and prints a list of your accounts with their respective balances. 
A program should use the very same protocol and interface a web browser uses - the HTTPS. 
This method is called screen-scraping or web-scraping.

* Simple console program, no need for a GUI
* Written in Java
* Should work correctly at least for your own bank account
* Choose any bank you have access to
* You can use any libraries you need but no headless browsers are allowed
* Code quality is equally important as correctness. Please aim to write the most beautiful code possible.
* Keep it simple. This is meant to be a small project and should take you something between several hours and several days at max.
